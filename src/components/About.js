        <p>
          I was born in Washington, DC, but I have been living in Atlanta, Georgia for the past two years.
          For the last decade, I worked in the wine and hospitality industries, specifically as a sommelier in New York City.
          Recently, I made the decision to transition my career in order to pursue my passion for technology.
          I enrolled in and successfully completed a full-stack coding bootcamp through Georgia Tech's professional education program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the bootcamp, I gained proficiency in various technologies and programming languages, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, React, and more.
          I am excited to leverage these skills and embark on a new journey as a web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently seeking employment opportunities that will allow me to continue learning and growing as a web developer.
          I am eager to contribute my knowledge and skills to create innovative and user-friendly web solutions.
